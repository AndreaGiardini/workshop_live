# Manage ArgoCD ... with ArgoCD!

It is possible to let ArgoCD manage itself! This is actually the recommended way of deploying ArgoCD, as described in the [docs](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#manage-argo-cd-using-argo-cd).

## Installing Tools

ArgoCD supports several ways of generating Kubernetes manifests.
Defining manifests is supported using different [Tools](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/application_sources/).

ArgoCD is very unopinionated and leaves the operator total freedom regarding
which tool to use to generate manifests. We will see:

* Kustomize
* Helm
* Plain YAML

### Kustomize

In the previous step, we installed ArgoCD manually using [Kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize).
In order to let ArgoCD manage itself, we need to make sure that it is able to run Kustomize

Open `argocd_deploy/kustomization.yaml` and uncomment the following section:

```
#patchesStrategicMerge:
#- overlays/argocd-cm.yaml
#- overlays/argocd-repo-server-deploy.yaml
```

After applying this change:
* Kustomize will be downloaded on boot
* ArgoCD will allow us to use it in our manifests

Apply the changes to the ArgoCD deployment by running:

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/argocd_deploy:/app/manifests k8s.gcr.io/kustomize/kustomize:v4.2.0 build manifests | kubectl apply -f -
```

At this point, Kustomize is installed in our ArgoCD instance and ready to be used.

## Add ArgoCD to the managed applications

All the tools needed are now installed and we are ready to let ArgoCD manage itself.
Whenever possible we should define our applications in a declarative way, the same applies for ArgoCD.

Find the ArgoCD definition at `argocd_deploy/apps/argocd.yaml`
Take some time to have a look at the file and replace the fields that need to be edited.

When you're done, uncomment this section in `argocd_deploy/kustomization.yaml`:

```
resources:
- resources/namespace.yaml
- apps/argocd.yaml
```

**Important: Commit all the changes in your repository and push it to your custom fork**

We need to do that because, after running the next command, ArgoCD will use our fork to look up its own definition.

Apply the changes manually one last time:

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/argocd_deploy:/app/manifests k8s.gcr.io/kustomize/kustomize:v4.2.0 build manifests | kubectl apply -f -
```

What will happen right now:
* We created a new application called ArgoCD, which manages the ArgoCD installation itself
* This application is defined in our forked repository
* Argo will clone the repo, build the manifest and apply them on our behalf

With this change, ArgoCD is now managing itself using the definition in our repository. Argo will clone our repo and verify that the resources deployed in the cluster correspond with the resources in our git repository.

From now on we will not have to run the `docker run [...] | kubectl apply -f` anymore: Argo is going to apply whatever change we push to our repo.

Verify in the ArgoCD interface that a new application has been installed and is marked as healthy.
